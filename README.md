# 16203115 Assignment 2
My partner Cathall Witham dropped the module and so, he could not contribute to this project.
As such, I was asked to submit the assignment with limited functionalities.

All functionalities that inculde slots are not included in this code.
As attacking needs slots as well, the attacking implementation is incomplete but is structurally and algorithmically correct.
